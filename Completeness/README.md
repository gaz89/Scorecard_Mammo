# Metadata Completeness Assessment

This repository contains code for the assessment of metadata Completeness.


[Full documentation](docs/_build/html/index.html)


The current itertion of the code takes a metadata csv file and a json metadata reference dictionary as input.
A list of matched, missing, and unexpected data header fields are returned as terminal output.
Visulaizations for field and record completeness can also be produced and saved in the `/output` directory.
The file inputs are currently hard-coded.

**This code is work-in-progress.**
